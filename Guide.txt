- Schema name, username, password, database_url (If any other relational database)
- File paths of your local system's directory. (Where you want to store all files provided by the interns)
- After cloning make sure all folders should be empty in the 'static' folder. (Otherwise filename generation can lead to conflicts)

# Create Super Admin & other roles:

3.

- Change details of super admin as your requirement. (In 's1' and 'user3' details has to be same, otherwise access issues will occur)

- Comment that 'loadInitialUsersInDB' section again

# Moving forward:

4.
